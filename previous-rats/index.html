    <h2>
      Previous Pet Rats
    </h2>
    <p>
      These are all my pet rats I have owned so far. Sadly, all of these rats
      have passed on but I have so many wonderful memories with all my pet rats.
      I raised Oreo from a baby, and adopted Audia to be her sister not long
      after. Rats live an average of 2 years, which is why I have had so many
      as pets in the last decade. I enjoy raising them from babies because they
      get plenty of human interaction that way and are much more trusting and
      friendly as they grow up. Plus, they are just so cute when they are babies
      with baby fur! After raising Oreo and Audia, the cycle continued over the
      years and I have enjoyed all my rats for their awesome personalities and
      unique attributes. Sadly, all of these rats have passed on, Noodle and Pookie
      were the most recent to pass in January 2020. I have so many wonderful
      memories with all my pet rats and I am very excited to be able to remember
      and share these memories through this webpage.

        <h3>Nina</h3>

        <figcaption>
          Nina would often sleep in my bed as I did my homework or watched
          movies. She was a grey rat with white marbling and a white belly.
          She was a snuggler and loved nap time very much. She also loved
          being scratched behind the ears as many rats do.

        <img src="previousratimages/blue-rex-rat-baby.jpg" alt="Picture of Choobie">
        <figcaption>
          I knew as soon as I saw Choobie as a baby that she was special.
          She was a Blue Rex Rat. Her fur color is Blue, and she has
          curly whiskers and wavy thick fur. The color "Blue" in the rat
          breeding industry describes a specific shade of grey with a blue hue.

        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/baby-pooch.jpg" alt="Picture of Pooch">
        <figcaption>
          Pooch was a very energetic baby, but I got her to sit still for
          this photo by letting her chew on my nail polish. She was a very
          athletic rat who loved to run and play. She could climb up almost
          anything and her sister Choobie was the same way.

        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/tilly-sleeping-on-kleenex-box.jpg" alt="Picture of Tilly">
        <figcaption>
          I adopted Tilly admittedly for her unique coloring. I loved the
          brown fur with black mixed in. She also had a white belly and white
          paws, which was a very cute look. She had a couple ear infections,
          but this didn't prevent her from having a full and happy life.

        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/marley-fidget-devlin.jpg" alt="Picture of my boy rats">
        <figcaption>
          These are my boys; Marley, Fidget, Devlin. I have a special place
          in my heart for my boys, they were so affectionate and fun. I
          adopted them when my brother's rat, which he bought from a pet
          store, gave birth to a litter of pups.

        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/nugget-laying-down.jpg" alt="Picture of Nugget">
        <figcaption>
          Nugget was also a unique rat due to her attributes. Her ears
          were set a little towards the sides of her head, rather than on
          top, which classifies her as a "Dumbo" rat. She loved being pet, and
          I have many pictures of her on her back as I rub her belly.

        <h3>Audia</h3>
        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/audia-with-lizard.jpg" alt="Picture of Audia">
        <figcaption>
          This is Audia, as a baby, hanging out with my brother's lizard.
          It's called a Uromastyx Lizard and they are primarily herbivorous.
          Not pictured is Audia's brother who, unfortunately, died as a baby
          when one of my brother’s snakes escaped it's cage.

        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/baby-oreo-on-lizard.jpg" alt="Picture of Oreo">
        <figcaption>
          This is baby Oreo on the lizard's back, going for a little ride.
          Oreo was the first rat I ever adopted so I was nervous for this first
          rat-to-lizard introduction. But it went very well, and the lizard
          carried her around for quite some time.

        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/peaches.jpg" alt="Picture of Peaches">
        <figcaption>
          Female rats tend to be smaller than male rats, but Peaches was the
          most petite of all my rats. She never never liked being in her cage
          and would chew on everything until I took her out. At least her teeth
          stayed trimmed, they grow continuously throughout a rat’s life.

        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/insieme-jacob-and-aldabella.jpg" alt="Picture of the three
        blonde rats as babies">
        <figcaption>
          The three blonde rats, as babies, are drinking from a bowl of warm
          milk. Aldabella was technically my sisters’ rat, but these three rat
          siblings got to grow up together. Jacob was a very shy guy, Insieme
          was a very loving rat, and Aldabella was fed very well and loved to
          show off her big tummy.

        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/noodle-peaking-from-under-blanket.jpg" alt="Picture of
        Noodle">
        <figcaption>
          Me or my sister probably called Noodle out to come get a treat
          from us. Most of my rats were trained to know that when we made
          kissy noises, they should come to us.They were motivated by food to
          do this. Rats are very intelligent and can learn all kinds of tricks.

        <h3>Pookie</h3>
        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/pookie-under-blanket.jpg" alt="Picture of Pookie">
        <figcaption>
          Pookie was relaxing and poked her head out to say "hi" to the camera.
          My sister helped take care of Pookie and Noodle when I had to move
          closer to the city for school. They were extra spoiled because of this
          and both had wonderful lives.

      Thank you for checking out my webpage! I hope you enjoyed learning
      about something that you may have previously not known much about. Maybe
      for some people this was a bit of an eye opener that domesticated rats
      are a great option for a pet and the stigma behind rats is not
      necessarily true. I thoroughly loved all my rats and found great
      joy in giving them spoiled lives rather than being doomed to be snake
      food.
