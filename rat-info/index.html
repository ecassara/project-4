      Rat Information
    </h2>
    <p>
      Here are some basic necessities in setting up a home for your pet rats.
      Rats need food, water, treats, bedding, a cage and hideouts, chew toys, and comfort
      items like hammocks and blankets.

        <h3>Food and Treat</h3>

        <figcaption>
          Rats need food everyday, but can also hoard extra food to eat in the
          future. The best treats for rats are fresh human foods like spinach,
          apples, and noodles. They can also eat store-bought treats like
          yogurt bites.

        <h3>Water</h3>

        <figcaption>
          It is best to change their water every day. A glass water dispenser is
          best because it prevents the rats from chewing it, but plastic can
          work as well. My water bottle has cute little ducks so I can see the
          water level from a distance.

        <h3>Cage and Hideouts</h3>

        <figcaption>
          Rats needs a lot of room to run and play. A cage with wire walls is ideal
          for good air circulation and so they can climb. Inside the cage, they
          should also have different places to hide and sleep. They need to feel
          secure and comfortable. I use tissue boxes and similar items.

        <figcaption>
          Rat's teeth grow their entire lives. It is important they have an
          abundance of things to chew on to help keep their teeth at a helathy
          length. Store-bought items work such as wooden ball chew toys but things
          like toilet paper rolls are also a good adition.

          A hammock provides a nice alternative location for rats to rest. Fabric
          is the best material, but make sure you wash it. Putting pieces of
          cloth around the cage is a nice addition of bedding material for them.

        <h3>Bedding</h3>

        <img src="ratinfopics/20200424_160938.jpg" alt="Picture of Bedding">
        <figcaption>
          There are paper-based and wood-based beddings. I prefer wood-based
          because it keeps any potential odors to a minimum. However, wood
          beddings can irritate rat lungs if it's too fragrant or dusty. I
          prefer aspen as it has the lowest amount of dust and has no oder. Pine
          can also work, but stop use if rats sneeze too much.
