    <h2>
      Current Pet Rats
    </h2>
    <p>
      These are my pet rats I currently own. I adopted them both from
      Critters Pet Shop in South Elgin. I got Roxy on March 25th, 2020 and her
      estimated birthday is February 23, 2020. I got Echo on May 1st, 2020 and
      her estimated birthday is March 8th, 2020.

          Roxy licked my hand when I first met her and she was very interactive.
          She continues to be full of energy and loves to play. Her personality
          comes through more andmore each day. She jumps around with joy when
          playing.

          Echo looks very similar to Roxy except her stomach has much more white
          and the tip of her tail is also white. Echo and Roxy are getting along
          much better together. Echo loves to follow Roxy around and learn from
          her.
